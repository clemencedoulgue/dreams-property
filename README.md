## üß™ Testing

### Manual Test Cases

1. **Property Listing Display Test**
   - Navigate to the home page
   - Verify that property listings appear with images, titles, prices, and location
   - Expected: All properties display correctly with their details

2. **Property Detail Navigation Test**
   - Click on a property card
   - Verify that you are redirected to the property details page
   - Expected: Property details page shows complete information about the selected property

3. **Add Property Form Validation Test**
   - Navigate to the "Add Property" page
   - Submit the form without filling required fields
   - Expected: Form shows validation errors and prevents submission

4. **API Response Test**
   - Send a GET request to /api/properties
   - Expected: Receive a JSON array of property objects with status 200

5. **Image Loading Test**
   - Navigate to the home page
   - Inspect network activity
   - Expected: SVG images load quickly and correctly

### Failed Test Cases (With Solutions)

1. **Image URL Validation Issue**
   - Problem: When submitting a property with a relative image path, the API returned a validation error: `"imageUrl" must be a valid uri`
   - Solution: Modified the Joi validation schema to accept relative paths by changing `Joi.string().uri().allow('')` to `Joi.string().allow('')`

2. **Port Conflict Issue**
   - Problem: Default port 3000 was already in use, causing server startup failures
   - Solution: Implemented dynamic port selection with fallback options and configured PORT in environment variables
